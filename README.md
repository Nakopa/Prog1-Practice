Oh Hello there, wandering, browsing civilian of github.
Welcome to my repo.
I dont know how you found this repo, but that doesnt matter all too much. This repo is all about Programming practice with different examples. For me. Others too, but mostly for me.
There are different examples of code, some are pure bullshit and some are masterpieces.
Feel free to roam and explore, maybe you'll get some inspiration?
